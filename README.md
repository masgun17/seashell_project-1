# SeaShell: Custom Shell - Operating Systems Project

Creating custom shell on Linux, using C.

###  Mertcan Aşgün - Emre Safter


As a group of 2 people, we added custom features to a shell program, provided by 
our instructor Didem Unat. Our custom features included calls to basic system calls, customizing 
and highlighting the outputs in the terminal, comparing two files by both reading 
line-by-line and bit-by-bit, setting timed events, and additionally, we added a 
feature to help students to open their ‘Zoom’ class links just by a terminal call, 
without requiring them to find the desired class’ link and password each time for 
each class. We wrote the code in C and executed it in both Linux Mint and Ubuntu.
